# Queens Game Solver

A Python-based N-Queens Solver with a graphical interface built using Tkinter. The application allows users to visualize the backtracking algorithm in real time or solve the puzzle instantly. Users can also customize the board size and colors. I was inspired by the [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/queens-game/posts/?feedView=all) Puzzle on LinkedIn as well as this [Github](https://github.com/MathsMarshall/LinkedIn_Queen_puzzle/tree/main) Repo by [Mmesomachi](https://github.com/MathsMarshall)
